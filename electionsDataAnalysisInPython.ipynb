    "This 2016 US Presidential election project consists of different variables which are related to the two parties they are Democrat and Republicans. By considering these attributes this project was designed to generate desired analysis. First the dataset is normalized and performed data analysis using python scripting. There are many things we can observed in this paper. All the attributes and its details are already defined initially in this document. The main task of this project is to make possible analysis like democratic votes in each county of 28 states, republican votes against democratic votes and candidates individual votes in different states. This project observed that there is a tough competition between Hillary Clinton, Trump and Ted Cruz. In most of the states Clinton got majority of the votes than the Republicans. In some counties there is a tough competiton between Ted and Trump with republicans. From this data analysis, Hillary Clinton got high chances of getting high majority of votes in the coming US Presidential Elections."
